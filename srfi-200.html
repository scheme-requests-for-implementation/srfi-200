<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI discusses some of the existing pattern-matching
  libraries for the Scheme programming language &mdash; namely,
  the pattern matcher presented by Andrew K. Wright and Robert
  Cartwright in the paper "A Soft Type System for Scheme", the
  pattern matcher developed by Dan Friedman, Erik Hilsdale and
  Kent Dybvig, the <code>racket/match</code> module
  distributed with the Racket programming environment, as well
  as the Bigloo and Gerbil pattern matchers distributed with
  their respective implementations.
  It then extracts a pattern syntax which is compatible with two of
  those implementations and provides extrinsic rationale for that
  syntax.
  It also provides a simple implementation of a pattern matcher
  which conforms to the specification of a pattern language provided
  in this document.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Pattern matching is a technique for (conditionally) naming
  components of compound data structures. It is commonly known
  in functional programming circles, and it has been adapted
  to the Scheme programming language in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>It also partially overlaps in functionality with
  the technique called <i>destructuring bind</i>, known from Common Lisp.</p>

<p>For example, instead of writing</p>

<pre>
  (cond ((and (list? x) (= (length x) 3) (eq? (car x) '+))
         (+ (cadr x) (caddr x)))
        (else
         'operation-not-supported))
</pre>

it is often more clear and concise to write

<pre>
  (match x
    (`(+ ,x ,y) (+ x y))
    (_ 'operation-not-supported))
</pre>

<p>Today, there exist a few different implementations that offer
  many extensions to the basic pattern-matching facility, and that
  are mutually incompatible.</p>

<p>The purpose to this SRFI is to codify the basic common features
  that are present in all or most of those libraries in order to
  facilitate the development of portable programs that utilize
  pattern matching.</p>

<p>This document isn't meant to serve as comprehensive documentation
  for any of the discussed libraries, as they are already well
  documented in their appropriate sources.</p>

<p>It does, however, provide a minimalist reference implementation
  expressed in terms of simple <code>syntax-case</code> macros,
  and an equivalent implementation expressed in terms of
  <code>syntax-rules</code> macros.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>The main interface to using syntactic pattern matching is the
  same for all libraries discussed in this document &mdash; namely,
  the <code>match</code> macro, which is used in the following way:</p>
<pre>
  (match expression
    (&lt;pattern-1&gt; &lt;actions-1*&gt; ... &lt;value-1&gt;)
     ...
    (&lt;pattern-N&gt; &lt;actions-N*&gt; ... &lt;value-N&gt;))
</pre>

<p>where <code>&lt;actions-<i>X</i>*&gt;</code> are optional sequences
  of expressions.</p>

<p>The <code>expression</code> is evaluated once, and its value is
  tested against the subsequent <code>&lt;pattern-<i>X</i>&gt;</code>
  patterns. When the first matching pattern
  <code>&lt;pattern-<i>K</i>&gt;</code> is encountered,
  the sequence of <code>&lt;actions-K*&gt;</code> is executed,
  and the value of the expression <code>&lt;value-K&gt;</code>
  becomes the value of the whole <code>match</code> expression.</p>

<p>The pattern may contain some variables (which are typically expressed
  using unquoted symbols). If it does, then those variables become the
  names of some parts of the data being pattern-matched, and the named
  parts can be referred to from the <code>&lt;actions-K*&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;value-K&gt;</code> expressions.</p>

<p>If the data does not match any of the patterns, the result
  of the expression depends on the pattern matcher under consideration:
  it may be either an unspecified value, some specified value or an error.
  However, since writing non-exhaustive patterns in <code>match</code>
  expressions is generally considered a bad practice, this aspect of
  the <code>match</code> form will not be further discussed in this
  document.</p>

<p>It is mainly the form, capabilities and the interpretation of the
  <code>&lt;pattern-<i>X</i>&gt;</code> expressions
  where the libraries differ.</p>

<h2>The Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher</h2>

<p>Probably the most common pattern-matching library distributed
  with some popular Scheme implementations is the
  <code><a href="http://synthcode.com/scheme/match.scm">match.scm</a></code>
  module developed by Alex Shinn in portable <code>syntax-rules</code> macros.  It is based on a specification developed by Andrew K. Wright
  and Robert Cartwright in their paper
  <a href="https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~feeley/cours/ift6232/doc/pres2/practical-soft-type-system-for-scheme.pdf">A Practical Soft Type System for Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>It is distributed along with many Scheme implementations, including
  Chibi (the <a href="http://synthcode.com/scheme/chibi/lib/chibi/match.html"><code>(chibi match)</code></a> module),
  Guile (the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html"><code>(ice-9 match)</code></a> module),
  Cyclone (the <a href="http://justinethier.github.io/cyclone/docs/api/cyclone/match"><code>(cyclone match)</code></a> module),
  LispKit (the <a href="https://github.com/objecthub/swift-lispkit/blob/master/Sources/LispKit/Resources/Libraries/lispkit/match.sld"><code>match.sld</code></a> file),
  Loko (the <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/loko/-/blob/master/lib/match.sls"><code>match.sls</code></a> file),
  Mosh (the <a href="https://mosh.monaos.org/files/lib/match-ss.html#Pattern_Match"><i>Pattern Match library</i></a>
  and Saggitarius (the <a href="http://ktakashi.github.io/sagittarius-online-ref/section81.html"><code>(match)</code></a> module).
  It is also available in the Chicken Scheme's repository as the
  <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/matchable">matchable</a>
  module.</p>

<h3>Simple patterns</h3>

<p>The <code>&lt;pattern-<i>X</i>&gt;</code> expressions are interpreted
  in the following way: if a pattern is a literal, then it matches
  the data that is equal to that literal. Otherwise, if it is a regular
  unquoted symbol (henceforth called <i>a pattern variable</i>), then
  the match succeeds, and the symbol gets bound to the value being pattern-matched.
  If the pattern is the special symbol <code>_</code> (underscore), then
  the match succeeds, but the symbol is not bound.</p>

<h3>Compound patterns</h3>

<p>Things become more interesting when the pattern is a pair, i.e.
  when it has the form <code>(<i>head</i> . <i>tail</i>)</code>.
  Roughly speaking, data matches such patterns if it is also a pair,
  the head of the data matches the head of the pattern, and
  the tail of the data matches the tail of the pattern. So for example,
  the list <code>(1 2)</code> matches the pattern <code>(a b)</code>
  (with <code>a</code> being bound to <code>1</code> and <code>b</code>
  being bound to <code>2</code>), but it also matches the pattern
  <code>(a . b)</code> (where <code>a</code> is bound to <code>1</code>
  and <code>b</code> is bound to <code>(2)</code>).</p>

<p>The same symbol can be used in a pattern more than once. When that's
  the case, the pattern matches only if all the occurrences of that
  symbol would be bound to values that are <code>equal?</code>: for
  example, the pattern <code>(a . a)</code> matches the value
  <code>(1 . 1)</code> or <code>((1) . (1))</code>, but it does
  not match the value <code>(1 . 2)</code> or the value <code>(1 1)</code>.</p>

<p>This allows one to define a function that removes adjacent <code>equal?</code>
  elements from a list in the following way:</p>

<pre>
  (define (unique elements)
    (match elements
      ((x x . rest)
       (unique `(,x . ,rest)))
      ((x . rest)
       `(,x . ,(unique rest)))
      (()
       '())))
</pre>

<p>For example, <code>(unique '(a a a b b b b a a c c))</code> evaluates
  to <code>(a b a c)</code>.</p>

<p>An equivalent definition that does not use pattern matching would
  look like this:</p>

<pre>
  (define (unique elements)
    (cond ((null? elements)
           '())
          ((and (pair? elements)
                (pair? (cdr elements))
                (equal? (car elements)
                        (cadr elements)))
           (unique (cdr elements)))
          (else
           (cons (car elements)
                 (unique (cdr elements))))))
</pre>

<h3>Compound literals and quasi-literals</h3>

<p>The previous section claimed that a value matches the
  <code>(<i>head</i> . <i>tail</i>)</code> pattern only if it is
  a pair and the head and the tail of the data matches the head
  and the tail of the pattern.</p>

<p>This is true in most circumstances. However, there are a few
  exceptions. Notably, if the pattern is a pair and its head is the
  <code>quote</code> symbol, then the data matches the pattern only
  if it is <code>equal?</code> to the tail of the pattern. For example,
  the symbol <code>'x</code> matches the pattern <code>'x</code>
  and the value of the expression <code>(list 1 2 3)</code> matches
  the pattern <code>(quote (1 2 3))</code>, or equivalently
  <code>'(1 2 3)</code>.</p>

<p>More interestingly, if the head of the pattern is the symbol
  <code>quasiquote</code>, then the pattern behaves similarly
  to quasi-quotation, attributing special meaning to the <code>unquote</code>
  symbol. In particular, this allows one to express
  the above definition of the function <code>unique</code>
  as:</p>

<pre>
  (define (unique elements)
    (match elements
      (`(,x ,x . ,rest)
       (unique `(,x . ,rest)))
      (`(,x . ,rest)
       `(,x . ,(unique rest)))
      ('()
       '())))
</pre>

<p>This feature exposes symmetry between pattern matching
  and quasi-quotation. However, the <code>unquote-splicing</code>
  operator is not implemented in the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher.</p>

<h3>Predicates</h3>

<p>The Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher also offers a special syntax for
  testing whether a given sub-pattern satisfies a certain predicate:
  if a pattern is a list whose first element is the <code>?</code>
  (question mark) symbol, then the second element of that list must
  be a unary predicate. The pattern matches if the predicate is
  satisfied.</p>

<p>Optionally, there may be a third element in the list. It is
  an additional pattern that needs to be satisfied by the datum.
  It is typically used for naming the element that satisfies
  the predicate.</p>

<h3>Ellipsis</h3>

<p>Even though the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher does not support
  the <code>unquote-splicing</code> operator, it provides
  the <code>...</code> (ellipsis) operator which behaves similarly
  to the one that can be found in the <code>syntax-rules</code>
  pattern language.</p>

<p>The <code>...</code> operator must appear in a list, following
  a pattern, but no more than one ellipsis is allowed to appear
  at a single level of nesting. The behavior of the operator is
  best illustrated with an example - the <code>palindrome?</code>
  predicate, which evaluates to <code>#true</code> iff its argument
  is a list <code>equal?</code> to its own reverse:</p>

<pre>
  (define (palindrome? list)
    (match list
      (()          #true)
      ((x)         #true)
      ((a b ... a) (palindrome? b))
      (_           #false)))
</pre>

<p>If <code>list</code> is <code>(1 2 3 2 1)</code>, then the
  first invocation of <code>palindrome?</code> will match the
  <code>(a b ... a)</code> pattern, binding <code>a</code> to
  1 and <code>b</code> to the list <code>(2 3 2)</code>.</p>

<p>The ellipsis operator can also be used with more complex patterns.
  For example, the expression</p>

<pre>
  (match '((a 1) (b 2) (c 3))
    (((s n) ...) `(,s ,n)))
</pre>

<p>evaluates to <code>((a b c)(1 2 3))</code>.</p>

<p>The ellipsis operator can be nested, so the pattern
  <code>((x ...) ...)</code> is also valid, even if difficult
  to substantiate.</p>

<h3>Boolean combinations</h3>

<p>The Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher also allows one to combine patterns using
  Boolean operators: <code>(and pat-1 ... pat-n)</code> matches
  if a given object matches all of the <code>pat-1 ... pat-n</code>
  patterns, <code>(or pat-1 ... pat-n)</code> matches if a given object
  matches any of the <code>pat-1 ... pat-n</code> patterns,
  and <code>(not pat-1 ... pat-n)</code> matches if an object does not match
  any of the <code>pat-1 ... pat-n</code> patterns.</p>

<h3>The complete grammar for the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher</h3>

<p>The specification of the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher provides
the following grammar:</p>

<pre>        patterns:                       matches:

  pat ::= identifier                      anything, and binds identifier
        | _                               anything
        | ()                              the empty list

        | 'symbol                         a symbol (special case of s-expr)

        | (and pat_1 ... pat_n)           if all of pat_1 thru pat_n match
        | (or pat_1 ... pat_n)            if any of pat_1 thru pat_n match
        | (not pat_1 ... pat_n)           if all pat_1 thru pat_n don't match
        | (? predicate pat_1 ... pat_n)   if predicate true and all of
                                          pat_1 thru pat_n match
        | (set! identifier)               anything, and binds setter
        | (get! identifier)               anything, and binds getter
        | `qp                             a quasi-pattern
        | (identifier *** pat)            matches pat in a tree and binds
        identifier to the path leading
        to the object that matches pat

  quasi-patterns:                 matches:

</pre>

<h2>The Racket pattern matcher</h2>

The Racket pattern matcher is typically shipped with the distribution
of Racket. In order to use it, one needs to <code>(require racket/match)</code>
in their Racket program. It can also be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/tree/master/racket/collects/racket/match">Racket's Github repository</a>.

<h3>Simple patterns</h3>

<p>The rules for simple patterns in the Racket pattern matcher are identical
  with those described above for the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher: literals
  match literals, symbols match and bind to anything, and the special symbol
  <code>_</code> (underscore) matches anything but binds to nothing.</p>

<h3>Compound patterns</h3>

<p>The rules for compound patterns in the Racket pattern matcher differ
  significantly compared to the compound patterns found in the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn
  matcher. In particular, compound patterns must be proper lists, and
  their first element must always be a special symbol understandable
  by the matcher. For example, if we want to match a pair <code>(a . b)</code>,
  we need to use the pattern <code>(cons a b)</code>; if we want to
  match a list <code>(a b)</code>, we need to use the pattern
  <code>(list a b)</code> and so forth.</p>

<p>Therefore, the <code>unique</code> function defined in the previous
  section could be translated to the Racket's pattern language in the
  following way:</p>

<pre>
  (define (unique elements)
    (match elements
      ((list-rest x x rest)
       (unique (cons x rest)))
      ((cons x rest)
       (cons x (unique rest)))
      ('()
       '())))
</pre>

<p>Overall, the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/match.html">documentation of Racket</a> provides a detailed list
  of symbols that are allowed in the head position of compound
  patterns.</p>

           |  __k                               k or more
</pre>

<p>A closer look at the rules reveals that some of the symbols allowed
  in patterns coincide with the ones in the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher. In particular,
  <code>quote</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>,
  <code>?</code>, and <code>quasiquote</code>.</p>

<h3>Pattern guards</h3>

<p>The Racket matcher also supports the feature known as <i>pattern guards</i>.
  A pattern guard is an additional condition which needs to be satisfied
  in order for a match to be considered successful.</p>

<p>In Racket, pattern guards are expressed using the <code>#:when</code>
  keyword following a pattern, followed by the condition. For example:</p>

<pre>
  (match '(1 2)
    (`(,a ,b) #:when (odd? (+ a b)) 'odd-sum)
    (_ 'unknown))
</pre>

<h3>Derived patterns</h3>

<p>The distinctive feature of the Racket matcher is the ability to provide
  <i>derived patterns</i>. In addition to the <code>match</code> form,
  Racket provides the <code>define-match-expander</code> extension mechanism,
  which allows one to define new types of patterns.</p>

<h2>The Bigloo pattern matcher</h2>

<p>The Bigloo pattern matcher is distributed
  <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo/manual-chapter6.html">along with</a>
  the Bigloo scheme implementation, but it is also
  <a href="https://stklos.net/Doc/html/stklos-ref-6.html">provided by</a> STKlos.
  According to the, it supports the following syntax:</p>

 <pre>
&lt;pattern&gt; ⇒                Matches:

  &lt;atom&gt;                    the &lt;atom&gt;.
| (kwote &lt;atom&gt;)            any expression eq? to &lt;atom&gt;.
| (and &lt;pat1&gt; ... &lt;patn&gt;)   if all of &lt;pati&gt; match.
| (or &lt;pat1&gt; ... ...&lt;patn&gt;) if any of &lt;pat1&gt; through &lt;patn&gt; matches.
| (not &lt;pat&gt;)               if &lt;pat&gt; doesn't match.
| (? &lt;predicate&gt;)           if &lt;predicate&gt; is true.
| (&lt;pat1&gt; ... &lt;patn&gt;)       a list of n elements. Here, ... is a
                            meta-character denoting a finite repetition
                            of patterns.
| &lt;pat&gt; ...                 a (possibly empty) repetition
                            of &lt;pat&gt; in a list.
| #(&lt;pat&gt; ... &lt;patn&gt;)       a vector of n elements.
| #{&lt;struct&gt; &lt;pat&gt; ... }    a structure.
| ?&lt;id&gt;                     anything, and binds id as a variable.
| ?-                        anything.
| ??-                       any (possibly empty) repetition of anything
                            in a list.
| ???-                      any end of list.

 </pre>

<p>The most apparent differences between Bigloo and the two matchers
  described above are the following:
<ul>
  <li>the pattern variables must begin with the <code>?</code> (question mark) symbol.
    All symbols that do not begin with the question mark (except <code>kwote</code>,
    <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>not</code> that have a special
    meaning) are treated as literal symbols;</li>
  <li>the special identifier <code>?-</code> is used (instead of <code>_</code>) to
    match anything without performing a binding;</li>
  <li>the <code>quasiquote</code> form is not supported.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>The Gerbil pattern matcher</h2>

<p>According to the
  <a href="https://cons.io/reference/core-prelude.html#pattern-matching">documentation</a>,
  the pattern matcher bundled with Gerbil Scheme supports the following syntax:
</p>

<pre>
(match expr
  (pattern body ...) ...
  [(else body ...)])

&lt;pattern&gt;:
 (? test)                          ; predicate test with the `?` predicate constructor
 (? test pattern)                  ; test and match a pattern
 (? test =&gt; pattern)               ; test and match a pattern on the value of the test
 (? test :: proc =&gt; pattern)       ; test and match with a filter
 (and pattern ...)                 ; match all patterns
 (or pattern ...)                  ; match any pattern
 (not pattern)                     ; negated match
 (cons pattern1 pattern2)          ; destructure a pair like cons
 (cons* pattern ... pattern-tail)  ; destructure a list like cons*
 [pattern ...]                     ;
 (@list pattern ...)               ; destructure a list like @list
 (box pattern)                     ;
 #&pattern                         ; destructure a box
 (values pattern ...)              ; destructure a values tuple
 (vector pattern ...)              ;
 #(pattern ...)                    ; destructure a vector
 (struct-id pattern ...)           ; destructure a struct
 (class-id (slot pattern) ...)     ; destructure a class
 (eq? val)                         ; match eq? to val
 (eqv? val)                        ; match eqv? to val
 (equal? val)                      ; match equal? to val
 (quote expr)                      ; match eq?/eqv?/equal? to a quoted value
 (quasiquote datum)                ; destructure with quasiquote
 (apply getf pattern)              ; applicative destructuring
 (match-macro arg ...)             ; apply match macro expander
 _                                 ; match any and ignore
 id                                ; match any and bind to id
 datum                             ; match eq?/eqv?/equal? to a datum

(match &lt;&gt; (match-pattern body ...) ...)
=&gt; (lambda (obj) (match obj (match-pattern body ...) ...))

(match &lt;...&gt; (match-pattern body ...) ...)
=&gt; (lambda args (match args (match-pattern body ...) ...))
</pre>

<p>The syntax is therefore largely compatible with the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn
  matcher and the Racket matcher. The noteworthy differences are the following:
  
</p>

<h2>The Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig pattern matcher</h2>

<p>A copy of the pattern matcher developed at Indiana University by
  Dan Friedman, Erik Hilsdale and Kent Dybvig can be found
  on <a href="https://github.com/guenchi/match">Github</a>.</p>

<p>The basic syntax of this pattern matcher is similar to the syntax
  of the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher, the key difference being that
  in the case of Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher, the patterns are <i>implicitly
  quasi-quoted</i>.</p>

<p>This means, that in order to adapt the basic patterns
  of the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher to the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher,
  one needs to wrap each pattern in a <code>quasiquote</code>. In other
  words, assuming that the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher is available
  under the <code>match/WCS</code> binding, then the basic syntax of
  the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher can be achieved via the following
  transformation:</p>

<pre>
  (define-syntax match/FHD
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((match/FHD (pattern . body) ...)
       (match/WCS ((quasiquote pattern) . body) ...))))
</pre>

<p>Consequently, the definition of the <code>unique</code> function
  would take the following form under the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig match
  syntax (note the lack of back-ticks):</p>

<pre>
  (define (unique elements)
    (match elements
      ((,x ,x . ,rest)
       (unique `(,x . ,rest)))
      ((,x . ,rest)
       `(,x . ,(unique rest)))
      (()
       '())))
</pre>

<p>Similarly, if the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher is available under
  the <code>match/WCS</code> binding, then we can obtain the subset of
  Wright-Cartwright-Shinn patterns that begin with <code>quasiquote</code>
  via the following transformation:</p>

<pre>
  (define-syntax match/WCS
    (syntax-rules (quasiquote)
      ((match/WCS ((quasiquote pattern) . body) ...)
       (match/FHD (pattern . body) ...))))
</pre>

<p>Of course, this only works for basic patterns, and doesn't include
  extensions like predicates or Boolean combinations.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the same basic quasiquotation patterns are also
  supported by the Racket pattern matcher.</p>

<h3>Pattern guards</h3>

<p>Similarly to the Racket's matcher, the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher
  supports pattern guards. However, it does not require the <code>#:when</code>
  keyword. Instead, it assumes that there are no <code>&lt;actions-X*&gt;</code>
  forms, and that a clause for the <code>match</code> macro can either have
  the form</p>

<pre>
  (&lt;pattern&gt; &lt;value&gt;)
</pre>

or

<pre>
  (&lt;pattern&gt; &lt;guard&gt; &lt;value&gt;)
</pre>

<h3>Grammar rules for the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher</h3>

The documentation provides the following syntax for patterns

<pre>
  Pat    ::= (Pat ... . Pat)
           | (Pat . Pat)
           | ()
           | #(Pat* Pat ... Pat*)
           | #(Pat*)
           | ,Id
           | ,[Id*]
           | ,[Cata -> Id*]
           | Id
</pre>

<h2>Other pattern-matching libraries</h2>

<h3>The <code>syntax-case</code>/<code>syntax-rules</code> pattern language</h3>

<p>Apart from the libraries discussed in this document, the core Scheme language
  already provides some pattern-matching capabilities, namely the
  <code>syntax-rules</code>/<code>syntax-case</code> pattern language.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the applicability of this language is limited to macro
  definitions. This limitation is hurtful to the souls of those Scheme
  programmers who are in love with minimalism, as it requires the duplication
  of the same feature in different context. However, fixing that flaw
  is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<h3>Structural pattern matching</h3>

<p>This document focuses on libraries which extend the syntax of Scheme
  with pattern-matching capabilities. It is perhaps worth mentioning
  that the term "pattern matching" is also sometimes used in a slightly
  different sense: not as a syntactic extension to a language, but as a function
  that takes an s-expression representing a pattern and some object, and returns
  a list of bindings (for example, in the form of an association list) that
  could turn a pattern into that object.</p>

<p>This kind of a pattern-matching library has been described, for example,
  in the <a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/blob/master/docs/chapter5.md">fifth chapter</a> of Peter Norvig's book
  <a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp">The Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</a>.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>Since pattern matching is a feature that has already been widely adapted
  by various Scheme communities, this document does not attempt to subvert
  this adaption. Instead, it aims at providing recommendations for writing
  future Scheme code that maximizes compatibility between the existing pattern
  matchers.</p>

<h2>Quasi-quotation is the preferred way of expressing patterns</h2>

<p>It has been noted that compound patterns that begin with quasiquote
  are compatible between the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher and
  the Racket matcher, and that the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher
  can trivially be adapted to make quasiquotations explicit.</p>

<p>For this reason, this document recommends that the compound
  patterns are expressed using explicit quasiquotation. </p>

<p>The additional advantage of this practice is that it shows
  a symmetry between quasiquotation and pattern matching.</p>

<p>In particular, it recommends sticking to the following subset
  of the pattern grammar, which is compatible with both Racket
  and Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher:</p>
/
<pre>
  pat ::= identifier                      anything, and binds identifier
        | _                               anything
        | ()                              the empty list
        | #t                              #t
        | #f                              #f
        | string                          a string
        | number                          a number
        | character                       a character
        | 'sexp                           an s-expression
        | 'symbol                         a symbol (special case of s-expr)
        | `qp                             a quasi-pattern

  quasi-patterns:                 matches:

  qp  ::= ()                              the empty list
        | #t                              #t
        | #f                              #f
        | string                          a string
        | number                          a number
        | character                       a character
        | identifier                      a symbol
        | (qp_1 ... qp_n)                 list of n elements
        | (qp_1 ... qp_n . qp_{n+1})      list of n or more
                                          of remainder must match qp_n+1
        | ,pat                            a pattern

</pre>

<h2>Incompatible features should not be used</h2>

<p>This document discourages the use of certain pattern-matching
  features, in particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pattern guards</li>
    <li>ellipses</li>
    <li>Boolean combinations (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
      <code>not</code>)</li>
    <li>predicates</li>
    <li>derived patterns</li>
    <li>catamorphism</li>
    <li>other extensions</li>
  </ul>

<p>More specifically, the uses of those extensions are obviously allowed,
  but using them makes a program non-SRFI-200-compliant, and thus unportable
  between different pattern matchers.</p>

<h2>Implementations</h2>

<p>Two of the three pattern matchers presented here already support the pattern
  language recommended by this SRFI.</p>

<p>
  The Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher implemented in terms of <code>syntax-rules</code>
  macros is available from <a href="http://synthcode.com/scheme/match.scm">Alex Shinn's website</a>.</p>

<p>
  The Racket pattern matcher is distributed with Racket, and is available from
  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/tree/master/racket/collects/racket/match">Racket's Github repository</a>.
</p>

<p>The Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher can be adapted to the pattern language
  by defining a macro <code>match<sub>WCS</sub></code></p>

<pre>
  (define-syntax match<sub>WCS</sub>
    (syntax-rules (quasiquote)
      ((_ ((quasiquote pattern) . body) ...)
       (match (pattern . body) ...))))
</pre>

<p>and re-exporting it to shadow the <code>match</code> binding provided by
  the Friedman-Hilsdale-Dybvig matcher.</p>

<p>
  A copy of the pattern matcher developed at Indiana University by
  Dan Friedman, Erik Hilsdale and Kent Dybvig can be found
  on <a href="https://github.com/guenchi/match">Github</a>.
</p>

<p>Lastly, one could use a simple reference implementation
  provided by this SRFI. The main interface to the matcher is the
  <code>match</code> macro, which valuates the expression
  to be pattern-matched on, and passes the work to the
  <code>match/evaluated</code> macro:</p>

<pre>
(define-syntax-rule (match expression (pattern actions* ... value) ...)
  (let ((evaluated expression))
    (match/evaluated evaluated (pattern actions* ... value) ...)))
</pre>

<p>The <code>match/evaluated</code> macro analyzes the first clause
  and passes itself recursively on the remaining clauses to the failure
  continuation of a <code>match-clause</code> macro. If there are no
  clauses left, it signals an error (which is an acceptable way
  of handling this situation, although not required):</p>

<pre>
(define-syntax match/evaluated
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((match/evaluated value)
     ;; This behavior is unspecified, and an "unspecified"
     ;; value would also be fine here.
     (error 'no-matching-pattern))

    ((match/evaluated value (pattern actions ...) . clauses)
     (match-clause ((pattern value))
                   (and)
                   ()
                   actions ...
                   (match/evaluated value . clauses)))))
</pre>

<p>The <code>match-clause</code> macro is responsible for converting the
  pattern into a <code>condition</code> (which is a conjunction of all conditions
  stemming from the pattern's sub-patterns) and <code>bindings</code>.</p>

<p>It maintains (and processes) a list of <code>(pattern path)</code> pair,
  where <code>path</code> is an expression consisting of nested <code>car</code>s
  and <code>cdr</code>s leading to the (evaluated) expression being pattern-matched.</p>

<p>It also carries around the set of <code>actions</code> to be performed when
  the match succeeds, as well as the form to be evaluated when it does not succeed.</p>

<p>When the <code>match-clause</code> encounters a nested pattern, i.e. a pair
  consisting of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> sub-patterns, it extends
  the <code>condition</code> with the requirement that the current target
  is a <code>pair?</code>, and it expands the list with the <code>left</code>
  and <code>right</code> sub-patterns.</p>

<p>When the <code>match-clause</code> encounters an identifier, then it extends
  the set of bindings with the current <code>path</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, when it encounters a literal value, it adds a check whether the
  object at current <code>path</code> is <code>equal?</code> to that value.</p>

<p>When the list is processed, then technically the macro could expand
  to the form <code>(if condition (let bindings actions ...) alternative)</code>, but
  since the matcher should handle repeated identifiers (with the requirement
  that they all point to fragments of data that is <code>equal?</code>),
  it expands to the <code>check/unique</code> macro, whose responsibility is
  to add necessary equality checks, and remove bindings with duplicate identifiers.</p>

<pre>
(define-syntax match-clause
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx (quasiquote unquote and _)
      ((match-clause () condition bindings actions ... alternative)
       #'(check/unique condition bindings #f () () actions ... alternative))

      ((match-clause ((`,pattern root) . rest)
                     condition
                     bindings
                     actions ... alternative)
       #'(match-clause ((pattern root) . rest)
                       condition
                       bindings

<p>As mentioned earlier, the <code>check/unique</code> macro is responsible
  for extending <code>condition</code> with equality checks if there is more
  than one instance of a given identifier, and to remove <code>bindings</code>
  with duplicate identifiers.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>bindings</code>, it maintains a currently processed
  <code>(variable path)</code> binding (or the <code>#f</code> value in the
  edge cases), a list called <code>bindings/checked</code>, consisting of
  all bindings that didn't contain the identifier currently being processed,
  and a list <code>bindings/final</code>, consisting of all bindings that
  were already tested against duplicates.</p>
